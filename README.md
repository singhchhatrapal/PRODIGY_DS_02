# PRODIGY_DS_2
In this Project I have used a data set of vrinda store of the Diwali sales. By using python libraries i have analyze the data of the sales and learn
1. Perform data cleaning and manipulations.
2.  2. Perform EDA using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

# TASKS IMPLEMENTED:
1] It utilizes Python Libraries like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn.

2] Extracting information from the dataset.

3] Data Cleaning

Checking for missing values. Handling missing values using imputation technique (Median). Dropping unnecessary columns.

4] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore survival rates by different features, class, age, gender, embarked and fare distribution. Visualize relationships between variables using various plots like countplot, scatterplot, boxplot, pairplot and histograms.

5] Plots based on Different Factors:

Created a various set of plots, each focuses on different aspects of the dataset (e.g. age distribution, fare distribution, etc.). Analyzed these plots to discover additional insights.

6] Correlation Matrix Analysis

Calculated and visualized correlation matrices for training and testing data. Created a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features.
